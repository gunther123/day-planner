# Day Planner

## Purpose
A website that allows you to schedule out your workday with To-dos during a specific hour of the day. You can save your To-Dos with the save button and they will stay on your calendar even if you close the browser. 

The website will always display the current date and change each hour block to a different color dependent on if the time is in the past, present, or future!

Gray = Past
Red = Present
Green = Future
